DS3231 RTC Interface for STM32CubeIDE
This repository contains a sample code for interfacing the DS3231 real-time clock (RTC) module with STM32CubeIDE. The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C-integrated RTC that provides an easy way to add a real-time clock and calendar to any microcontroller project.

Features
Initialization and configuration of the DS3231 RTC module using STM32CubeIDE.
Reading and setting the current date and time from the DS3231 RTC.
Alarm configuration and interrupt handling using the DS3231 module.
Requirements
STM32CubeIDE installed on your development machine.
STM32 microcontroller development board with I2C interface.
Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
Connect your STM32 development board to your machine and build/upload the code.
Follow the comments in the code to understand the DS3231 RTC interface implementation.
Usage
This code provides a starting point for integrating the DS3231 RTC module into your STM32CubeIDE projects.
Modify and expand the code as per your project requirements.
